# DEI-OD1

SQL database for the second Oficina de Design I (Digital Workshop I) project @ FCTUC.

## Installation

The od1.sql should preferably be imported into an empty table.

## Tables

### Rooms
* ID (Auto Incremented INT)
* Room (e.g. _F1.1_)

### Services
* ID (Auto Incremented INT)
* Name (e.g. _GAPI — Gabinete de Apoio a Projectos de Investigação_)

### Teachers
* ID (Auto Incremented INT)
* Name (e.g. _Alberto Jorge Lebre Cardoso_)

## Contributing

Students should fork this project and work on top of the original table structure, by adding any information that's relevant to the project:

e.g.
* adding office hours for teachers, by creating a table which makes use of the teachers and rooms tables;
* establishing relations between services and rooms.
